# Drug Activity Prediction

Given a set of training data of a 2d matrix, be able to predict compound activity based on its attributes

For the control implementation, I used Naive Bayes approach to classify.
For the main implementation, I used a scikit-learn library to create a neural network to predict the classifications of a testing record set.
